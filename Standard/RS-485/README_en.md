# Modbus registers for Standard RS485
The ``.xls`` file contains the latest address table to communicate with the device via the Modbus protocol. Registers marked with blue or grey are not (yet) functional.

``.xml`` is the config template that can be used to connect Standard to [Rapid SCADA](https://rapidscada.org/), also via Modbus.
